# :notebook::pencil2: GW2 TODO List

## This is a WIP, but usable

Web interface to track progress on items

No backend is used, everything happens in your own browser. No data
is stored outside your PC

## Data stored in localStorage

- Token: Your API Token
- Language: Language to retrieve information from the API. Default: English
- Account materials: Materials in your account to avoid asking the API all the time
- Items: List of items that you have included in the TODO List

## TODO list

- Detect if item is already in inventory or unlocked
- Refresh buttons for "heavy" api queries
- Export / Load button to download a json with all the info, so you can take it to other PCs
- Add bulk: To add multiple chat links at once
- Progress bar on the different items?
- Possibility to reorder items in the list?
- Nice CSS (PR are welcome :grin:)
